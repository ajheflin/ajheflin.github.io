Hi, and welcome to Employment Squared.

Please view our website at http://employmentsquared.com

Alternatively, you can view it on your local computer (However, viewing it at http://employmentsquared.com is the preferred method).

Please note, if you're trying to run this website on a local computer, it's important that you have PHP installed. If you don't have PHP installed, you can still run the website on your local machine, but the contact form will not function as intended (There will be code displayed to the user due to the fact that the PHP is not read as PHP code; instead it is read as plain text). Everything else will function as it should, provided that you open the files in a web browser (Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, etc...).

Thank you.
~The Employment Squared Team.
